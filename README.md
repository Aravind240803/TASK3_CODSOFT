**Movie Rating Prediction**

This project aims to predict the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and actors using a Random Forest Regressor model. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results.

**Dataset**

The dataset used is `IMDb Movies India.csv`, which contains information about movies including their genre, director, actors, and ratings.

**Dependencies**

pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

You can install the dependencies using the following command: pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

**Description**

movie_rating_prediction.py: This is a Python script containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and prediction.

**Results**

Mean Squared Error (MSE): The MSE of the Random Forest Regressor model on the test set is printed.
Actual vs Predicted Ratings: A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between actual and predicted ratings.
Count of Movies by Top 10 Directors: A count plot showing the distribution of movies for the top 10 directors.
Distribution of Actual vs Predicted Ratings: A histogram comparing the distribution of actual and predicted ratings.
